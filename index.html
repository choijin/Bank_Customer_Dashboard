  <p>We have a map of United Kingdom and we look at the data from a certain bank and how its customers are distributed across the different regions of the UK. We also have a distribution of the same customers by different balance bands, also by ages. These age and balance bands can be controlled and adjusted, and the dashboard reflects the changes immediately. 

Segment our customer base and understand how to service them better.

Let’s say the bank comes up with an insurance offering or some kind of new product that involves insurance. If the bank wants to market the insurance offering to the existing customers, then you would approach it differently based on the regions. 

England is mostly represented by white collar workers (70%)

In Scotland, you know that your customers are in their late, 40s and early 50s. They are predominantly male and mostly blue collar workers. 

Data for Wales shows an above average representation of mid-sized balances, mostly in their 30s, 56% female, and 58% white collar workers.

In Northern Ireland, you can see a completely different picture. You can see that they’re predominantly female in their late 20s to early 30s. 

Therefore, the method of promotion should be different based on different region. For Northern Ireland, the promotion could focus on taking care of life changing events such as purchasing homes or getting married, as these events are important for people in their twenties and thirties. In contrast, most customers in Scotland have already experienced these events and are established. The promotion might sound something like, this insurance is important because it will help you protect the people you love and it will help you look after your families, etc.

This customer segmentation dashboard is extremely useful for businesses because they can benefit from the types of segmentations by being able to sell their products in more tailored fashion, making offerings to people who are more relevant. </p>
